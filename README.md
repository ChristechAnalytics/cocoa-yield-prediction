# üå± Cocoa Yield Prediction Based on Climate Variables - Ikom, Nigeria

## üìå Project Objective
Predict annual cocoa yield in Ikom Local Government Area, Cross River State, using climate variables such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

## üß† Background
This project is based on a real dataset from my undergraduate thesis, which explored the impact of climate variability on cocoa yield in Nigeria‚Äôs cocoa-producing region, Ikom LGA. Cocoa is highly sensitive to climate, and understanding these patterns is vital for sustainable agriculture.

## üìÇ Project Structure
```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                  # Raw dataset (2013‚Äì2022 climate + cocoa yield)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/             # Jupyter notebook for EDA and modeling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                   # Python scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                   # Streamlit web app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             # Standard gitignore rules
```

## üöÄ Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Data scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Regression models: Random Forest, Linear Regression
- Feature importance visualizations
- Streamlit-based prediction interface

```

## üî¨ Model Insights
- Top influencing features: **Solar Radiation** and **Minimum Temperature**
- Models evaluated using RMSE and R¬≤
- Model performance is suitable for guiding cocoa production decisions

## üìä Dataset
Manually curated from research logs and climate archives:
- **Years:** 2013‚Äì2022
- **Location:** Ikom LGA, Cross River State, Nigeria
- **Source:** Cross River State Ministry of Agriculture logbooks & remote sensing datasets (CRU, TRMM, ERA-Interim)
